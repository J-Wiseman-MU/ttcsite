This is a website for playing, saving, and loading games of tic-tac-toe tied to various user accounts. To run on your local machine pull the repository,  navigate to the dockerfiles at ttcsite/djangobackend and ttcsite/react-front/react-frontend, and build them using docker build. If you want to deploy this to the internet, make sure to change the settings in /djangobackend/djagobackend/settings.py to restrict CORS origins and CRSF origins.
